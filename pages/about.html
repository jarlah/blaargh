<h1 id="about - me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am a full stack software developer. But the term "full stack" is misused. Its sort of like a term used for someone who can get things up and running, that be backend, frontend, mobile or integration services. Not an expert in any of these fields, but I am specifically interested in getting value to the customer. Given that goal, it doesnt really matter what stack I am working on as long as its not destroying my productivity and sense of accomplishment. It helps of course being a stack built on the jvm and/or javascript/typescript/clojurescript/scalajs/++ on the frontend.</p>
<p>I work every day with a simple goal. Getting better at what I am doing. This includes accepting my own errors and miscalculations. Code is not personal. Discussing or attacking code is not the same as attacking the developer who made that particular piece of code. It should and must be possible to discuss code without being subjective. That said I am no expert at this, but its one of the things I strive to get better at.</p>
